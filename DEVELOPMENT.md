# Setup and Deployment Guide for Convex Project

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up a project using Convex, configure environment variables, and deploy it to Vercel. The guide assumes the project is already created, and you are now focusing on configurations and deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Node.js** installed (preferably version 18 or later).
- **Vercel account** (sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)).
- **Convex account** (sign up at [convex.dev](https://www.convex.dev)).
- **GitHub or GitLab** repository for your project.

## Steps to Set Up the Project

### 1. Clone the Project

If you haven't already cloned your project, do so by running the following command:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-folder>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

In the project folder, run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root directory. Add the following environment variables:

```env
# Google Client Auth ID for authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_AUTH_ID=<your-google-client-auth-id>

# Convex deployment URL (for local development)
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=<your-convex-deployment-id>

# Convex URL for interacting with Convex API
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=<your-convex-api-url>

# Gemini API key (if applicable to your project)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-gemini-api-key>

# Control dialog alerts in production (set to true for production)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCTION_USE=false
```

Replace the placeholders (`<your-*`) with the correct values that correspond to your project.

### 4. Configure Convex

Convex requires a **deployment ID** and **API URL** to interact with the backend. Hereâ€™s how to get them:

1. **Create a Convex Project**:

   - Go to [Convex](https://www.convex.dev) and sign in.
   - Create a new project or use an existing one.
   - After creating the project, you will receive a **deployment ID** and **API URL** for your project.

2. **Add the Convex Variables**:
   - Add the **deployment ID** to the `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` variable in `.env.local`.
   - Add the **API URL** to the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` variable in `.env.local`.

### 5. Test Locally

Once your environment variables are set, test the project locally to ensure everything is working. Run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to check if everything is running as expected.

### 6. Set Up Deployment on Vercel

Now, letâ€™s set up Vercel to deploy your project.

#### 6.1 Connect to Vercel

1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign in to your account.
2. Click on **New Project**.
3. Import your project from GitHub or GitLab (wherever your repository is hosted).
4. Choose the correct repository for the project and click **Deploy**.

#### 6.2 Set Environment Variables in Vercel

1. After connecting the project, go to the **Vercel Dashboard**.
2. Select your project and go to the **Settings** tab.
3. Scroll down to **Environment Variables**.
4. Add the following environment variables (use the same keys as in `.env.local`):

   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_AUTH_ID`
   - `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCTION_USE`

Ensure the values match those from your local `.env.local` file.

#### 6.3 Deploy to Vercel

1. After adding the environment variables, click **Deploy** again.
2. Vercel will build and deploy your project automatically.

Once the deployment process finishes, Vercel will provide a unique URL where your project is live.

### 7. Final Configuration

- If you need to configure any further settings like routing, database connections, etc., update the configuration files and redeploy to Vercel.
- You can also enable continuous deployment in Vercel to automatically redeploy whenever you push new changes to your GitHub or GitLab repository.

### 8. Accessing the Deployed Application

Once the deployment is finished, you can access your application through the URL provided by Vercel.

# Conclusion

Your Convex-based project is now set up and deployed on Vercel! ðŸŽ‰

With the environment variables configured both locally and on Vercel, your project should interact with Convex and other external services seamlessly in production. Make sure to check the logs in the Vercel dashboard for any errors and debug if necessary.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
